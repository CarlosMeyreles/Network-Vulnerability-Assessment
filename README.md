# Network Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective

Conducted a network vulnerability assessment using NMAP and Wireshark tools as part of a college course assignment on emerging technologies in cybersecurity. This project involved scanning a network configured in a Star Topology to identify active hosts and their open ports, discovering vulnerabilities, analyzing network traffic for anomalies, and providing recommendations to mitigate identified risks.

### Skills Learned

- Network Scanning and Enumeration: Utilized NMAP to discover active hosts and open ports within a network.
- Vulnerability Assessment: Identified and analyzed vulnerabilities using CVE identifiers and provided remediation strategies.
- Traffic Analysis: Used Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, identifying anomalies and their implications.

### Tools Used

- NMAP: A network scanning tool used to identify active hosts and open ports.
- Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic.
- Zenmap: The graphical user interface for NMAP, which was used to visualize the network topology and active hosts.

## Steps

Network Topology Identification: The network was identified to be configured as a Star Topology. Active hosts and their open ports were discovered using Zenmap.

Active Hosts Overview: An overview of the active hosts, their operating systems, and open ports was created.

Vulnerability Discovery: Vulnerabilities for each host were identified based on the open ports and operating systems. CVE identifiers were used to detail specific vulnerabilities.

Analysis of Vulnerabilities: Each identified vulnerability was analyzed for its potential impact and implications, such as denial of service and unauthorized data access.

Anomalies Identification: Network traffic was captured and analyzed using Wireshark to identify anomalies such as unencrypted passwords being transmitted over FTP and data being downloaded via unsecured HTTP.

Recommendations: Based on the identified vulnerabilities and anomalies, recommendations were provided to mitigate the risks, including updating outdated operating systems, switching to secure protocols (e.g., from FTP to SFTP), and enforcing the use of HTTPS.

## Summary and Findings:

Network Topology

- The network was configured as a Star Topology with six active hosts.

Summary of Vulnerabilities and Implications
- Host: 10.168.27.10
  - Operating System: Microsoft Windows 2012
  - Open Ports: 135, 139, 389, 445, 49152, 49154, 49155, 49157
  - Vulnerability: Outdated OS (CVE-2018-8438)
  - Implications: Could lead to a denial of service, making online services unavailable.

- Host: 10.168.27.15
  - Operating System: Microsoft Windows 7 Pro or Windows 8
  - Open Ports: 7, 9, 13, 21, 80, 135, 139, 445, 49154, 49155
  - Vulnerability: Open port 21 (CVE-2009-2929)
  - Implications: Potential for multiple SQL injections, leading to unauthorized data access and modification.

Wireshark Anomalies & Implications

- First Anomaly: Passwords being read via open FTP port.
  - Implications: Data interception and unauthorized access due to unencrypted data transmission.

- Second Anomaly: Use of HTTP for downloading content.  
  - Implications: Risk of data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, and privacy breaches.

Recommended Solutions

- First Vulnerability: Update the outdated OS and ensure the latest patches are applied.
- Second Vulnerability: Switch from using FTP (port 21) to SFTP/SSH (port 22) for secure data transmission.
- First Anomaly: Use SSH/SFTP (port 22) to encrypt data transmissions.
- Second Anomaly: Enforce the use of HTTPS instead of HTTP to secure data transmission with encryption and verification.
